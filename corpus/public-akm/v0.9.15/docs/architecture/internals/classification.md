# Classification System

akm recognizes files through **bundle adapters**. Each adapter owns a bundle
format and exposes a `recognize()` primitive that inspects a single file (path +
frontmatter + content) and returns an `IndexDocument` — the item's
subdir-qualified `conceptId`, type, renderer, and metadata — or `null` if the
adapter does not claim the file. There is no longer a global matcher registry;
the per-format adapter is the unit of recognition.

## Built-in adapters

The registry is a **static frozen list** (`BUILTIN_ADAPTERS` in
`src/core/adapter/adapters/index.ts`, exposed through
`src/core/adapter/registry.ts`) — always populated at module load, no
registration call required. Eleven built-ins, in probe order:

| Adapter id | Format | Recognizes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `website-snapshot` | Crawled website snapshot bundle (read-only) | snapshot pages |
| `agent-skills` | Agent-skills package (root `SKILL.md`) | skills |
| `claude` | A `.claude/` tool directory | commands, agents, skills, settings-adjacent files |
| `opencode` | An `.opencode/` tool directory | commands, agents, skills |
| `dotenv` | Env-file bundle | env/secret whole-file assets (values never indexed) |
| `akm-workflow` | Workflow-dir component | workflow programs |
| `akm-task` | Task-dir component | scheduled task definitions |
| `llm-wiki` | LLM Wiki bundle | a wiki root (`schema.md` + `pages/`) and its pages, raw, xrefs, citations |
| `akm` | The classic AKM bundle layout | scripts, skills, commands, agents, knowledge, instructions, workflows, memories, lessons, env, secrets, facts, tasks, sessions |
| `okf` | Open Knowledge Format bundle | OKF concept documents of any open type |
| `generic-files` | Catch-all file mount | explicit configuration only — never auto-probed |

`looksLikeRoot` probes run most-specific-first in the list order above; the
first match wins and the winner is recorded per component. A root matching no
probe falls back to `akm` (see `FALLBACK_ADAPTER_ID` in
`src/indexer/installations.ts`).
`generic-files` never participates in probing.

Configured adapter ownership wins over probing. `akm add` records the detected
adapter so later indexing does not reinterpret a bundle. The broad OKF probe
also recognizes index-less typed Markdown, but strong AKM layout evidence runs
first because AKM Markdown is an OKF-compatible superset.

See [Bundle Types](../../reference/bundle-types.md) for the user-facing detail
per adapter — conceptId/ref shape, what's indexed, `validate()` checks, and
read/write status in 0.9.0.

## Item types

`type` is an open descriptive string. The core accepts every non-empty value;
the owning adapter decides whether a value receives specialized behavior. The
`akm` adapter emits its fourteen defined native types (`script`, `skill`,
`command`, `agent`, `knowledge`, `instruction`, `workflow`, `memory`,
`lesson`, `env`, `secret`, `fact`, `task`, `session`) — see
[Bundle Types](../../reference/bundle-types.md) for the full
purpose / agent-output table per type.

`wiki` is **no longer an item type**. Multi-page wikis are a bundle *format* owned
by the `llm-wiki` adapter, not a per-file type stamped by the classifier.

## Reserved structural files

`index.md` and `log.md` are reserved structural files for the `akm`, `okf`, and
`llm-wiki` adapters. OKF defines their meaning in OKF bundles; AKM and LLM Wiki
reserve the same names under their own format contracts. Other adapters own
their reserved-name rules.

## Adapter-owned filtering (AKM sensitive/infra abstention)

Each adapter decides which walked files it claims and which it abstains on — the
core always excludes VCS internals and symlink escapes. An OKF walk includes
ordinary dot directories and `bin/` because those paths can identify conformant
concepts; AKM keeps its existing cache/dot-directory hygiene. The `akm`
adapter's `recognize` abstains (returns `null`) on its own bundle's
non-content files, using **path/stat checks only** so the bytes of sensitive files
are never read to make the decision:

- an `env/…` `.env` file that has a sibling `.sensitive` marker;
- anything under the frozen legacy `vaults/` directory (the `vault` type was
  removed in 0.9.0);
- a `secrets/` `.sensitive`/`.lock` marker, or a secret with a sibling
  `<name>.sensitive` marker;
- a `wikis/<name>/` root-level infrastructure file (`schema.md`/`index.md`/`log.md`).

This policy previously lived in the indexer's `shouldIndexStashFile` pre-filter; it
now lives in the adapter (`akmStashAbstains` in
`src/core/adapter/adapters/akm-adapter.ts`), so each adapter owns its own bundle's
filtering (owner ruling 2026-07-21).

## The akm adapter's recognition signals

Inside the `akm` adapter, recognition picks a winner by **specificity descending**,
ties broken by registration order (later wins). The signals:

| Specificity | Signal | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 25 | `SKILL.md` (skill directory) | `skill` |
| 20 | `tools` frontmatter | `agent` |
| 19 | workflow markdown structure | `workflow` |
| 18 | command frontmatter / `$ARGUMENTS` body placeholders | `command` |
| 15 | immediate parent dir hint | directory-specific type |
| 10 | ancestor dir hint | directory-specific type |
| 8 | `model` frontmatter only | weak `agent` signal |
| 5 | fallback markdown | `knowledge` |
| 3 | known script extension | `script` |

### Directory signals

- `scripts/` → `script`
- `skills/` → `skill`
- `commands/` → `command`
- `agents/` → `agent`
- `knowledge/` → `knowledge`
- `workflows/` → `workflow`
- `memories/` → `memory`
- `lessons/` → `lesson`
- `env/` → `env`
- `secrets/` → `secret`
- `tasks/` → `task`

### Markdown signals

| Signal | Type | Specificity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools` in frontmatter | `agent` | 20 |
| workflow heading/step structure | `workflow` | 19 |
| `agent` in frontmatter | `command` | 18 |
| `$ARGUMENTS` or `$1`-`$3` in body | `command` | 18 |
| `model` in frontmatter only | `agent` | 8 |
| any other `.md` | `knowledge` | 5 |

## Asset quality values

The `quality` field marks how an item was produced. Four values are well-known:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"generated"` | Heuristically indexed; included in default search |
| `"curated"` | Human-authored; included in default search |
| `"enriched"` | LLM enrichment pass has run for this item; included in default search |
| `"proposed"` | Pending review; excluded from default search, opt-in via `--include-proposed` |

Unknown string values warn once at runtime and remain searchable.

## Examples

| File | Winning signal | conceptId |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/deploy.sh` | parent dir (15) → `script` | `scripts/deploy.sh` |
| `skills/review/SKILL.md` | `SKILL.md` (25) → `skill` | `skills/review` |
| `commands/release.md` with `agent: coder` | command frontmatter (18) | `commands/release` |
| `agents/reviewer.md` with `tools:` | frontmatter (20) → `agent` | `agents/reviewer` |
| `workflows/release.md` with workflow structure | structure (19) → `workflow` | `workflows/release` |
| `env/prod.env` | parent dir (15) → `env` | `env/prod` |
| `secrets/deploy-token` | parent dir (15) → `secret` | `secrets/deploy-token` |
| `docs/guide.md` | fallback (5) → `knowledge` | `knowledge/guide` |
